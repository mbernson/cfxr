# cfxr

This is a macOS/Cocoa port of [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html), a tool to quickly create video game sound effects for game jams.

My fork has been updated so that it runs on macOS 10.14 and later. You can grab a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/mbernson/cfxr/releases)!

## Build instructions

Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and install SDL:

```
brew install sdl
```

After that, you should be able to Build & Run cfxr in Xcode.
